# Commodity Pricing Grid —  COGS Sensitivity Model

## Purpose

This model maps 50 raw material inputs across 10 representative consumer goods categories in India and enables scenario testing of commodity price shocks on Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

The objective is governance-oriented: to improve understanding of transmission structure, margin sensitivity, and input risk concentration at a Board level.

This is not a trading tool. It is a strategic oversight lens.

## What This Model Demonstrates

• Raw material intensity differs materially across sectors  
• Broad inflation shocks transmit asymmetrically  
• Semiconductor exposure behaves differently from metals exposure  
• FMCG pass-through dynamics differ from Automotive cost structures  
• Margin resilience is a composition question, not a macro headline

---

## Methodology Overview

• 50 raw materials mapped across Automotive, Electronics, Appliances, FMCG  
• 73–80% of COGS allocated to mapped input materials  
• Remaining portion treated as labour, overheads, and logistics  
• 4-quarter price trends incorporated for baseline comparison  
• User-adjustable sensitivity inputs allow scenario testing

New COGS = Σ (Material Cost × (1 + User % Change)) + Unmapped Cost

Compositions are derived from:
• Indian listed company disclosures
• Industry body publications
• Manufacturing economics reports
• Teardown analyses
• Public commodity price sources

Where exact breakdowns are proprietary, industry-standard estimates are used.

## Governance Use Case

This model is intended to support discussion around:

• Margin sensitivity oversight  
• Commodity hedging frameworks  
• Working capital volatility  
• Pricing strategy resilience  
• Supply chain risk concentration  
• Capital allocation under inflationary pressure

---

## Limitations

• Component-level cost structures are not audited  
• Electronics input prices rely partly on industry estimates  
• Labour and overhead assumptions are static  
• This model is indicative, not a substitute for internal cost systems

Board Reflection Question

If a broad 3% commodity shock produces asymmetric COGS impact across segments, does the Board receive transmission dashboards granular enough to distinguish structural sensitivity from macro noise?
